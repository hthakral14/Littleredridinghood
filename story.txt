Little Red Riding Hood is a young girl who lives in a village near a forest.
She is known for always wearing a red hooded cloak made by her grandmother,
which is why everyone calls her Little Red Riding Hood.

Little Red Riding Hood loves visiting her grandmother, who lives alone in a
small cottage on the other side of the forest.

One morning, her mother prepares a basket with muffins, honey, and herbal tea.
She asks Little Red Riding Hood to take the basket to her grandmother and warns
her to stay on the path and never talk to strangers.

Little Red Riding Hood promises to obey and starts walking through the forest.
While walking, she meets a wolf. The wolf is a dangerous and dishonest animal.

The wolf asks Little Red Riding Hood where she is going. She tells him she is
going to her grandmother’s house. The wolf pretends to be kind and tricks her
into picking flowers so that he can reach the grandmother’s house first.

While Little Red Riding Hood is distracted, the wolf runs to the cottage.
He knocks on the door, enters the house, locks the grandmother in a closet,
and disguises himself as her.

Later, Little Red Riding Hood arrives at the cottage and notices that her
grandmother looks strange. While talking to her, the wolf suddenly reveals
himself and tries to attack Little Red Riding Hood.

At that moment, a woodsman hears the noise and enters the cottage.
He scares the wolf away, saves Little Red Riding Hood, and frees the grandmother.

The grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood are safe again.
Little Red Riding Hood returns home safely.

Moral lesson:
Children should never talk to strangers and should always listen to their elders.
